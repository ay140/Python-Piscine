# üï∞Ô∏è What does epoch mean?
# In computing, epoch refers to a fixed point in time that computers use as a reference to calculate time.

# For most systems, especially Unix-based ones (like Linux, macOS, and even Python), the epoch is set to:

# January 1st, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC
# This date is known as the Unix Epoch. Time is counted as the number of seconds since that exact moment.
